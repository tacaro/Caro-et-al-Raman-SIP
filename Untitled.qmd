# The macromolecular composition of the cell

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

As a starting point, let's assume the % total dry weight of a cell is as follows:

| Component                 | \% dry wt.          |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Nucleic Acids (DNA + RNA) | 23 (20 RNA + 3 DNA) |
| Proteins                  | 50 - 55             |
| Lipids                    | 7 - 9               |

Excluding other cellular components, the ratio of nucleic acids : proteins : lipids is 23 : 50 - 55 : 7 - 9

```{r}
calculate_PL_H_frac <- function(headgroup = "P")
```
